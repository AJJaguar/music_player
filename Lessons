Use 2 box shadows with 3/4 properties for neumorphism
use 3 colours [1 for scaffold and container then 2 for two box shadows
colors can be colors.grey.shade700, colors.grey[700]

learnt about offset (-5, -5, 5, 5) in box shadow

extracted widget with a final child to give container(child: center: child: child:)

use of safearea, edgeinsets symmetric

space between + padding in row solves problem

learnt icons [shuffle, repeat, skip-previous, play-arrow, skip-next, arrow_back_ios vs new]

percent indiator package

colors.transparent to render invisible

sizedbox <=> container to control dimensions

top light shadow vs bottom dark shadow in neumorphism

find a widget in the design which will be used throughout

use center to test reusable widget at start

padding solves lots of problem

const doesn't agree with color grey[300]
